🚀 90 Days of DevOps - Week 1: Networking Challenge 🌐

Week 1 of the #90DaysOfDevOps journey was all about Networking, one of the fundamental pillars of DevOps! Here’s a recap of what I learned and accomplished:

✅ OSI & TCP/IP Models – Broke down real-world applications of each layer (like HTTP at the Application Layer & TCP at the Transport Layer). Understanding how data flows through networks is crucial!

✅ Key Protocols & Ports – Researched essential protocols like SSH (22), HTTPS (443), DNS (53) and their significance in DevOps workflows. Created a handy reference guide to keep them at my fingertips!

✅ AWS EC2 & Security Groups – Launched an EC2 instance and explored Security Groups. Wrote a step-by-step guide on configuring security rules to protect cloud resources.

✅ Networking Commands – Practiced essential commands like ping, traceroute, netstat, curl, dig. Compiled a cheat sheet to make troubleshooting smoother.

This was an exciting deep dive into networking! Next up: Week 2 – Linux Fundamentals! 🐧
